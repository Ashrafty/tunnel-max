# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that the TunnelMax VPN application properly integrates and utilizes the sing-box core for VPN functionality. Currently, the app has a complete Flutter UI and platform channel infrastructure, but lacks the actual sing-box core implementation that powers the VPN connections. This integration is critical for the app to function as a working VPN client.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VPN user, I want the app to establish actual VPN connections using the sing-box core, so that my internet traffic is properly routed through VPN servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates a VPN connection THEN the system SHALL utilize the sing-box core to establish the connection
2. WHEN a VPN connection is active THEN the system SHALL route all network traffic through the sing-box proxy
3. WHEN the sing-box core encounters an error THEN the system SHALL report the error to the Flutter UI
4. WHEN the VPN connection is established THEN the system SHALL provide real network statistics from sing-box

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sing-box core to be properly integrated into the native platform code, so that the VPN functionality works on both Android and Windows platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the sing-box core library
2. WHEN a VPN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL convert it to sing-box compatible format
3. WHEN the sing-box core is running THEN the system SHALL monitor its status and health
4. WHEN the app is terminated THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup sing-box resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a VPN user, I want the app to support multiple VPN protocols through sing-box, so that I can connect to different types of VPN servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a VLESS configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL configure sing-box for VLESS protocol
2. WHEN a VMess configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL configure sing-box for VMess protocol
3. WHEN a Trojan configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL configure sing-box for Trojan protocol
4. WHEN a Shadowsocks configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL configure sing-box for Shadowsocks protocol
5. WHEN an unsupported protocol is provided THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a VPN user, I want real-time network statistics and connection monitoring, so that I can see my connection performance and data usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the VPN is connected THEN the system SHALL collect real-time statistics from sing-box
2. WHEN statistics are updated THEN the system SHALL send them to the Flutter UI via platform channels
3. WHEN the connection fails THEN the system SHALL detect the failure and attempt reconnection
4. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt the connection accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for sing-box operations, so that I can debug issues and provide user support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sing-box encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN a connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error codes and messages
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL expose sing-box internal logs
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL categorize it appropriately for user display
