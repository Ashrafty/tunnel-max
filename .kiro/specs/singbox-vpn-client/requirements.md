# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a cross-platform VPN client application that works on Windows and Android platforms, utilizing the singbox core for VPN functionality. The application will provide users with a secure, reliable VPN connection with an intuitive user interface for managing VPN configurations and connections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install and run the VPN client on my Windows or Android device, so that I can establish secure VPN connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user installs the application on Windows THEN the system SHALL provide a native Windows application that integrates with the system tray
2. WHEN the user installs the application on Android THEN the system SHALL provide an Android APK that can be installed and run on Android devices
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the singbox core and display the main interface
4. IF the application fails to start THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and logging information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure VPN server connections, so that I can connect to different VPN servers based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the configuration screen THEN the system SHALL allow input of server details including host, port, protocol, and authentication credentials
2. WHEN the user saves a configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration parameters and store them securely
3. WHEN the user imports a configuration file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the configuration format compatible with singbox
4. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect and disconnect from VPN servers, so that I can control when my traffic is routed through the VPN.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a server configuration and clicks connect THEN the system SHALL establish a VPN connection using singbox
2. WHEN the VPN connection is established THEN the system SHALL display connection status and update the UI to show connected state
3. WHEN the user clicks disconnect THEN the system SHALL terminate the VPN connection and restore normal network routing
4. IF connection fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and maintain the disconnected state
5. WHEN the VPN is connected THEN the system SHALL route network traffic through the VPN tunnel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor my VPN connection status and performance, so that I can verify the connection is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the VPN is connected THEN the system SHALL display real-time connection status including server location and connection duration
2. WHEN the VPN is active THEN the system SHALL show network statistics including data transferred and connection speed
3. WHEN the connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately to reflect the current state
4. IF the connection drops unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL notify the user and attempt automatic reconnection if configured

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle network changes gracefully, so that my VPN connection remains stable when switching networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device network connection changes THEN the system SHALL detect the change and maintain VPN connectivity if possible
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL pause the VPN connection and resume when connectivity returns
3. WHEN switching between WiFi and mobile data on Android THEN the system SHALL maintain the VPN connection seamlessly
4. IF network changes cause connection issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear status updates to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my VPN configurations and preferences to be stored securely, so that my sensitive connection information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user saves VPN configurations THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data including passwords and keys
2. WHEN the application stores user preferences THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate secure storage mechanisms
3. WHEN the user uninstalls the application THEN the system SHALL provide option to remove all stored configuration data
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL protect stored configurations from access by other applications
